<p style="margin-left: 40px"> <i>  Went from playing tennis for three years to playing football for the first time.

Friends, family, teachers, they all expect me to get decent grades, to get a good ACT score, to win awards, and participate in clubs. And most importantly, they all EXPECT me to play tennis.

<p style="margin-left: 40px"> <i> Football has taught me that success can be intangible. I rarely played in games and I would get wrecked in practice by bigger and more experienced players, however, I still felt more success playing football than tennis.
